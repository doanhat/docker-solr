# Solr in Docker

This GitHub repository defines a Docker container for running Solr on Windows.

The images used in this repository are based on Windows Container technology and can only be run using Docker Engine for Windows Containers.

For Solr images that run on Linux-based containers refer to the [official Solr page](https://store.docker.com/images/solr) on the Docker Store.

## What is Apache Solr?

Solr is the popular, blazing-fast, open source enterprise search platform built on Apache Luceneâ„¢.
